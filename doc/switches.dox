/**
@page switches Switches

libinput supports a couple of switches. Unlike button events that come in
press and release pairs, switches are usually toggled once and left at the
setting for an extended period of time.

Only some switches are handled by libinput, see @ref libinput_switch for a
list of supported switches. Switch events are exposed to the caller, but
libinput may handle some switch events internally and enable or disable
specific features based on a switch state.
